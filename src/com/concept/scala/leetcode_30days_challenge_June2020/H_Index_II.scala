  * @see https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/june-leetcoding-challenge/541/week-3-june-15th-june-21st/3364/
  *      OR
  *      https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index-ii/
  *
  *
  *      Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
  *
  *      According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."
  *
  *      Example:
  *
  *      Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
  *      Output: 3
  *      Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had
  *      received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively.
  *      Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining
  *      two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
  *      Note:
  *
  *      If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
  *
  *      Follow up:
  *
  *      This is a follow up problem to H-Index, where citations is now guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
  *      Could you solve it in logarithmic time complexity?
